# Hi, I'm Kaushik,

I design things, write code, create content, and dream of the 80s & 90s.
I'm a 21-year-old student at Purdue University currently studying web development and design.

As I've grown as a developer, I've worked alongside senior designers and developers who have raised my standards for whats expected of any web application.

Through these experiences, I've had the opportunity to create memorable products that are not only enjoyable to use but are written in code that's maintainable and easy to understand.
